✅ SECRET SPECIAL SAUCE - PSYCHOLOGICAL AUDIO LAYERS

WHAT MAKES IT UNREPLICABLE:

1. ✅ THETA WAVES (6Hz)
   - Frequency: 4-8Hz range
   - Effect: Freeze-gut paralysis, fear induction
   - Creates subconscious fear response
   - Hard to detect but affects brain state

2. ✅ GAMMA SPIKES (40Hz)
   - Frequency: 40Hz (BDNF hijack frequency)
   - Timing: 25%, 50%, 75% through video
   - Effect: Triggers attention/memory formation
   - Makes content "stick" in viewer's mind

3. ✅ BINAURAL BEATS
   - Left: 200Hz, Right: 208Hz
   - Creates 8Hz binaural beat (theta range)
   - Brain state manipulation
   - Creates unique psychological signature

4. ✅ SUBLIMINAL FREQUENCIES (17Hz)
   - Below conscious hearing threshold
   - Still affects brain activity
   - Creates hidden psychological trigger
   - Undetectable by casual listeners

5. ✅ UNIQUE FREQUENCY WATERMARK
   - Generated from timestamp
   - Unique ID: 3000-4000Hz range
   - Each video has different signature
   - Makes each video unique

HOW IT WORKS:
- These frequencies are mixed at subtle levels (15-20% volume)
- Voice stays dominant but psychological layers affect subconscious
- Creates unique "fingerprint" in each video
- Hard to replicate without exact frequency formulas

WHY IT'S UNREPLICABLE:
1. Complex frequency layering (5+ layers)
2. Unique watermark per video
3. Specific timing of gamma spikes
4. Exact theta/gamma/subliminal ratios
5. Binaural beat configuration

PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS:
- Theta: Fear, paralysis, attention
- Gamma: Memory formation, focus
- Binaural: Brain state change
- Subliminal: Subconscious triggers
