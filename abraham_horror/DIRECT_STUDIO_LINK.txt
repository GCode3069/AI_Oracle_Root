================================================================================
WHY ALL VIDEOS ARE "SHORTS":
================================================================================

YouTube automatically classifies videos as "Shorts" if:
1. Duration is 60 seconds or less
2. Format is vertical (1080x1920)

Your videos ARE uploading successfully, but they appear as Shorts because
they're under 60 seconds. This is NORMAL and EXPECTED.

TO SEE THEM:
- They appear in "Shorts" tab (because <60s)
- They ALSO appear in "Videos" tab (all videos appear there)
- CHECK BOTH TABS!

================================================================================
IF VIDEOS DON'T APPEAR:
================================================================================

1. WAIT 1-2 minutes - YouTube needs time to process
2. REFRESH browser - Press Ctrl+F5 (hard refresh)
3. CHECK "Videos" tab - Not just "Shorts" tab
4. FILTER by date - Sort by "Newest first"
5. CHECK console output - Look for upload errors

================================================================================
TEST & DEPLOY COMMAND:
================================================================================

cd F:\AI_Oracle_Root\scarify\abraham_horror
python ABRAHAM_COMEDY_YOUTUBE_COMPLETE.py 5

This generates 5 videos and uploads them. Check the URLs shown in console
output. They will also appear in your channel at the links above.
