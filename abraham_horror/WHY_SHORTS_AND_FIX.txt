WHY ALL VIDEOS ARE SHORTS - AND HOW TO FIX IT
================================================================================

THE ISSUE:
----------
All your videos appear as "Shorts" because:
1. They're under 60 seconds duration
2. They're vertical format (1080x1920)
3. YouTube auto-classifies them as Shorts

THE SOLUTION:
-------------
The new comedy generator creates videos that:
- Can be 15-60 seconds (Shorts)
- Can be 60+ seconds (Regular Videos)
- Appear in BOTH tabs

CHECK BOTH TABS:
---------------
1. Shorts Tab:
   https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCS5pEpSCw8k4wene0iv0uAg/videos/short

2. Videos Tab (CHECK THIS TOO!):
   https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCS5pEpSCw8k4wene0iv0uAg/videos

YouTube uploads BOTH:
- Shorts appear in "Shorts" tab
- ALL videos appear in "Videos" tab (including Shorts)

WHY VIDEOS MIGHT NOT APPEAR:
-----------------------------
1. Processing delay (wait 1-2 minutes)
2. Looking only at "Shorts" tab (check "Videos" tab!)
3. Filter by date (newest first)
4. Browser needs refresh (Ctrl+F5)
5. Upload silently failed (check console output)

FIXED IN NEW SYSTEM:
--------------------
- Uploads show progress
- Uploads show Video ID
- Uploads show Studio link
- Uploads show which tab to check
- Handles both Short and Regular video formats

TEST IT:
--------
Run: .\DEPLOY_NOW_COMEDY.ps1 -Count 3

This will:
1. Generate 3 comedy videos
2. Upload to your channel
3. Show you EXACTLY where to find them
4. Give you direct links
