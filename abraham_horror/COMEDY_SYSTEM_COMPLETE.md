Abraham Lincoln here. Dead motherfucker talking. I'm watching this headline:

thousand men dead. And y'all worried about this man's feelings? His FEELINGS?

*[Carlin]* You know what's the difference between me and modern politicians? 
I actually believed in something. I was willing to DIE for it. These people? 
They're willing to LIE for it.
