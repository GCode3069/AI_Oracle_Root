NON-CRITICAL NOTES
================================================================================

⚠️  CHAPMAN_2025_YOUTUBE_AUTO.py has placeholder text for optional image API
   → This is INTENTIONAL - it has working fallback (generate_fallback_image)
   → System works without it - just won't use your custom image API
   → To enable: Update IMAGE_API_URL and IMAGE_API_KEY in that file
