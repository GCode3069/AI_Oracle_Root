    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [language]/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [platform]/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manifests/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ upload_[lang]_[platform]_[timestamp].json
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ description_[lang]_[platform]_[timestamp].txt
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pinned_[lang]_[platform]_[timestamp].txt
```

## Generated Files

### Upload Manifest (`upload_*.json`)
Contains complete metadata for video uploads:
- Title and description
- Pinned comment text
- Tags and privacy settings
- Story snippet
- Timestamp

### Description File (`description_*.txt`)
Plain text description ready for copy-paste into upload forms.

### Pinned Comment File (`pinned_*.txt`)

## Integration with Existing Scripts

The system is designed to work alongside:
- `MasterControl.ps1` - Core content generation
- `MasterLaunch.ps1` - Orchestration and deployment

## Monetization Macros

The system attempts to load external monetization macros from:
1. `$env:SCARIFY_MACROS_PATH` environment variable
2. `../cli/SCARIFY-Monetize-Macros.ps1` (relative to script location)

If external macros are not found, it falls back to built-in templates.

## Configuration

Global configuration is stored in `$Global:Config` and includes:
- Supported languages with voice mappings
- Platform configurations
- Genre options
- AI model selections

## Helper Functions

### Core Helpers
- `New-Point($x, $y)` - Creates System.Drawing.Point objects
- `New-Size($w, $h)` - Creates System.Drawing.Size objects  
- `Ensure-Dir($path)` - Creates directories if they don't exist

### Monetization
- `Ensure-MonetizationMacros()` - Loads external macro scripts
- `Invoke-MonetizationForItem()` - Generates monetization content

### Content Generation
- `GlobalContentGenerator` class - Handles multi-language content
- `Start-GlobalContentGeneration()` - Main processing function with cancellation

## Requirements

### Windows Version
- Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 6+
- .NET Framework (for Windows Forms)

### Cross-platform Version
- PowerShell Core 6+
- No additional dependencies

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful degradation when monetization macros are unavailable
- Validation of user selections
- Progress preservation during cancellation
- Detailed logging of operations

## Testing

Run the test version to verify functionality:
```powershell
.\GlobalLauncher-Test.ps1
```

This will create sample output files demonstrating the complete workflow.
