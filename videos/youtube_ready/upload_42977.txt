TITLE (copy this):
You Won't Believe Lincoln's Take on Breaking: Coffee Prices R #42977

DESCRIPTION (copy all):
So breaking happened.
            
            In related news, I had a sandwich for lunch.
            
            These two facts are equally relevant to your life.
            
            Actually, the sandwich might be more relevant. 
            At least you know what a sandwich is.
            
            Can anyone actually explain what breaking means? 
            Without using the words "unprecedented" or "historic"?
            
            Didn't think so.
            
            Bitcoin address below. It's like a sandwich but for the internet.
