  "script": "Skyscrapers cast shadows that move when no one is watching. The city never sleeps, but something else is awake within it. the real city exists between heartbeats. Every street leads deeper into the maze. Every turn takes you further from home. The subway rumbles beneath your feet, but it's not the trains you hear. As night falls, the streets rearrange themselves. there's nowhere left to hide.",
