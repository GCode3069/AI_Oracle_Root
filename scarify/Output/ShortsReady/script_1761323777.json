  "script": "Every street leads deeper into the maze. Every turn takes you further from home. Neon signs flicker in patterns that spell warnings only your subconscious can read. As night falls, the buildings start to breathe. your reflection doesn't follow you anymore. The city breathes at night. Its breath smells of decay and forgotten dreams. The city never sleeps, but it remembers what you try to forget. you see the city's true face.",
