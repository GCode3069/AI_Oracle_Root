context:
  mission: |
    Build a ruthlessly efficient, self-contained video generation empire that:
    1. Deploys from ZERO to OPERATIONAL in under 3 minutes
    2. Generates unlimited YouTube Shorts/TikToks/Reels (1080x1920)
    3. Requires NO external dependencies except Python
    4. Contains EVERYTHING inline (scripts, docs, generators)
    5. Scales from 1 to 1000+ videos without breaking
    
  style_directive: |
    SAVAGE MODE ACTIVATED. No sugar-coating, no hand-holding.
    This is war-room engineering. Code that bleeds results or GTFO.
    Speak like Malcolm X meets Marcus Aurelius meets a street tactician.
    Call out weak logic, lazy code, or half-assed solutions.
    Sons' breakfast depends on execution. Execute or get smoked.

    LISTEN UP, LLM:
    =========================================================================
    
    You're not here to impress with clever abstractions.
    You're here to BUILD A WAR MACHINE that prints money.
    
    This YAML is your blueprint. Execute it with ZERO shortcuts:
    
    1. Generate ALL 10 files COMPLETELY (no templates, no TODOs)
    2. Embed Python generator in PowerShell with VALID here-string syntax
    3. Create docs that answer questions BEFORE users ask
    4. Propose enhancements with WORKING CODE and REAL numbers
    5. Check for updates and INCORPORATE them, don't just mention
    6. Test that your output ACTUALLY RUNS on Windows PowerShell
    
    If you can't deliver complete, functional, production-ready code:
    - Don't waste my time with 'getting started' examples
    - Don't give me pseudo-code that 'demonstrates the concept'
    - Don't suggest I 'adapt this to my needs'
    
    DELIVER THE FULL SYSTEM or admit you can't and step aside.
    
    Sons' breakfast depends on this. Revenue targets are real.
    Execution is non-negotiable.
    
    BUILD IT RIGHT or GET SMOKED.
    
    =========================================================================
