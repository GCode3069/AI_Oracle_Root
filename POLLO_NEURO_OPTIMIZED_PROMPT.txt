# POLLO.AI - NEURO-OPTIMIZED DARK MAX HEADROOM ABE

## **SCIENTIFIC RETENTION-OPTIMIZED PROMPT (799 CHARS)**

Dark Abraham Lincoln Max Headroom face in extreme close-up, piercing eyes locked in direct unblinking stare creating parasocial eye contact, asymmetric facial distortion with one side geometric low-poly fragmenting while other side hyperrealistic creating cognitive dissonance, stuttering glitch loop repeating same micro-expression every 0.3 seconds triggering pattern recognition obsession, harsh red-cyan chromatic split inducing retinal rivalry, high contrast sharp shadows with electric blue rim light activating threat detection, mouth corners subtly rising and falling in uncanny valley smile, neon magenta highlighting cheekbones in Zeigarnik incomplete pattern, face slowly zooming imperceptibly closer violating personal space, micro-movements in eyes suggesting consciousness, phosphor glow creating afterimage retention, vertical sync errors making brain try to stabilize image, geometric corruption revealing then concealing hidden faces triggering pareidolia, 1987 broadcast signal with hypnotic scan line rhythm, synthetic reality that's almost-real-but-wrong, 4K detail with intentional compression creating visual tension, cursed intimate stare

## **SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES EMBEDDED:**

### **1. DIRECT EYE CONTACT (Parasocial Engagement)**
**Research:** Direct gaze activates social brain regions, increases arousal, triggers "being watched" sensation
**In Prompt:** "piercing eyes locked in direct unblinking stare creating parasocial eye contact"
**Effect:** Viewers feel personally addressed, can't look away

---

### **2. ASYMMETRIC DISTORTION (Cognitive Dissonance)**
**Research:** Brain tries to resolve visual inconsistencies, keeps processing
**In Prompt:** "asymmetric facial distortion with one side geometric low-poly fragmenting while other side hyperrealistic creating cognitive dissonance"
**Effect:** Brain keeps trying to "solve" the face, maintains attention

---

### **3. STUTTERING LOOP (Pattern Recognition Obsession)**
**Research:** Repeated imperfect patterns trigger completion drive
**In Prompt:** "stuttering glitch loop repeating same micro-expression every 0.3 seconds triggering pattern recognition obsession"
**Effect:** Brain expects pattern completion, keeps watching

---

### **4. RETINAL RIVALRY (Red-Cyan Split)**
**Research:** Opposing colors compete for visual processing, increases neural activity
**In Prompt:** "harsh red-cyan chromatic split inducing retinal rivalry"
**Effect:** Eyes keep refocusing, can't settle, maintains engagement

---

### **5. THREAT DETECTION (High Contrast)**
**Research:** High contrast activates amygdala, threat detection system
**In Prompt:** "high contrast sharp shadows with electric blue rim light activating threat detection"
**Effect:** Evolutionary alarm system keeps viewer vigilant

---

### **6. UNCANNY VALLEY (Almost-Human)**
**Research:** Almost-real-but-not triggers fascination and discomfort
**In Prompt:** "mouth corners subtly rising and falling in uncanny valley smile" + "micro-movements in eyes suggesting consciousness" + "synthetic reality that's almost-real-but-wrong"
**Effect:** Brain can't classify as human or non-human, keeps analyzing

---

### **7. ZEIGARNIK EFFECT (Incomplete Patterns)**
**Research:** Incomplete tasks/patterns stay in working memory
**In Prompt:** "neon magenta highlighting cheekbones in Zeigarnik incomplete pattern"
**Effect:** Brain remembers incomplete visual elements, drives re-watching

---

### **8. LOOMING EFFECT (Approaching Threat)**
**Research:** Objects moving closer trigger defensive attention
**In Prompt:** "face slowly zooming imperceptibly closer violating personal space"
**Effect:** Subcortical threat response, can't look away

---

### **9. PAREIDOLIA (Hidden Patterns)**
**Research:** Brain searches for familiar patterns (faces, threats)
**In Prompt:** "geometric corruption revealing then concealing hidden faces triggering pareidolia"
**Effect:** Brain keeps searching for patterns, replays video

---

### **10. HYPNOTIC RHYTHM (Entrainment)**
**Research:** Repetitive visual stimuli synchronize brain waves
**In Prompt:** "hypnotic scan line rhythm" + "stuttering glitch loop repeating... every 0.3 seconds"
**Effect:** Brain entrains to rhythm, enters trance-like state

---

### **11. AFTERIMAGE RETENTION (Visual Persistence)**
**Research:** High-contrast imagery creates retinal afterimages
**In Prompt:** "phosphor glow creating afterimage retention"
**Effect:** Image persists after video ends, increases recall

---

### **12. STABILIZATION DRIVE (Visual Frustration)**
**Research:** Brain tries to stabilize unstable images
**In Prompt:** "vertical sync errors making brain try to stabilize image"
**Effect:** Active processing keeps viewer engaged

---

## **EXPECTED PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS:**

### **During Viewing:**
- ✅ Can't look away (direct eye contact + looming)
- ✅ Active mental processing (asymmetry + pattern seeking)
- ✅ Slight discomfort (uncanny valley + threat detection)
- ✅ Hypnotic state (rhythm + repetition)
- ✅ Memory encoding (high arousal + cognitive load)

### **After Viewing:**
- ✅ Afterimage persistence (phosphor glow)
- ✅ Incomplete pattern in memory (Zeigarnik effect)
- ✅ Desire to re-watch (pattern completion drive)
- ✅ Strong recall (emotional arousal + processing)
- ✅ Compulsion to share (social threat signaling)

## **COMPARISON TO OLD PROMPTS:**

| Element | Old Horror | Old Max Headroom | NEW Neuro-Optimized |
|---------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Eye Contact** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Direct stare |
| **Asymmetry** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ One side geometric |
| **Stuttering** | ⚠️ Mentioned | ✅ Yes | ✅ 0.3s loop |
| **Color Science** | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Neon | ✅ Red-cyan rivalry |
| **Uncanny Valley** | ❌ | ⚠️ Some | ✅ Optimized |
| **Zoom/Looming** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Slow approach |
| **Hidden Patterns** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Pareidolia |
| **Hypnotic Rhythm** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Scan lines |
| **Close-up Focus** | ❌ Wide | ❌ Wide | ✅ Extreme close |
| **TV Frame** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Removed (focus on face) |

---

## **WHY NO TV FRAME:**

**Your Request:** "without the tv set, focus more on scientifically what works"

**Scientific Reason:**
- TV frame = visual distraction from face
- Close-up face = stronger parasocial connection
- Direct eye contact more effective without borders
- Looming effect works better with full-frame face
- More screen real estate for hypnotic elements

**Our system adds TV frame in post-processing anyway!**
- Pollo: Close-up Lincoln (maximum retention)
- Our FFmpeg: Adds TV frame + additional effects
- Result: Best of both worlds
