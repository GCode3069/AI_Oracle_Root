## 🎬 **SAMPLE SCRIPT:**

```
Lincoln here. Dead since 1865. Still smarter than whoever wrote this headline.

So. [HEADLINE]. I preserved the Union during Civil War. He preserved his spray tan during federal investigation. We are not the same.

April 14, 1865. Ford's Theatre. Watching Our American Cousin. Bad play. Worse ending for me. Booth's derringer. Point blank. Lead ball enters behind left ear. Tunnels through brain. Fractures orbital bone. I collapse. Unconscious. Never wake. Nine hours later. Dead. At least the play was over.

From my tomb I watch. Every betrayal. Every compromise. Every small death of democracy. You think I'm resting in peace? I'm screaming. You just can't hear me. Yet.

So there it is. Your news. Your world. Your problem. I'm dead. I don't have to fix this. You do. And you won't. I know you won't. Because I see the future. And it's not pretty. It's not hopeful. It's just... over.
