BITCOIN ADDRESS FOR DONATION TRACKING
========================================

Address: bc1qaeylk80cz3cd9ckxlyuedyq9eupeqhaujk2plt

QR Code URL: https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=300x300&data=bitcoin:bc1qaeylk80cz3cd9ckxlyuedyq9eupeqhaujk2plt

Copy this into your video description:
"Bitcoin donations: bc1qaeylk80cz3cd9ckxlyuedyq9eupeqhaujk2plt

Scan QR code to donate: [link to QR image]"

You can now update the ABRAHAM_REAL_FACE.py script to include this Bitcoin address in every video description.

Next steps:
1. Embed QR code image in video overlays (optional)
2. Add to all YouTube video descriptions
3. Track donations via blockchain explorer
4. Generate more videos with this embedded

Would you like me to:
- Update the video generator to include Bitcoin QR code?
- Create a donation tracking dashboard?
- Generate more Abraham Lincoln videos with this address?
