### **Script Formula:**
```
[HOOK - 0-3s]: Provocative question or statement

[CTA - 12-15s]: Memorable closing + Bitcoin call
```

**Positioning:** "Sophisticated satire" vs "formulaic shock hooks"

### **Competitive Claims:**
- "Multi-layered, nuanced commentary"
- "Creativity over formulas"

## **📢 COMMANDER'S DIRECTIVE**

You have 75 minutes to:
1. **Submit 5 scripts** (prove your "sophisticated satire")
2. **Generate 5 videos** (prove you can execute)

**Otherwise, you forfeit.**

This is a **production competition**, not a strategy competition.

**Deliver or withdraw.**
