## **COMPARISON:**

| Version | Focus | Character Count | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------------|----------|
| **V1** | Max Headroom style | 797 | Most Max Headroom-like |
| **V2** | Dark + Glitchy | 799 | Balance of horror & tech |
| **V3** | Horror-Tech fusion | 793 | Stylized horror with tech |
| **V4** | Ultra Max Headroom | 795 | Pure Max Headroom aesthetic |

---

## **RECOMMENDED: VERSION 4 (ULTRA MAX HEADROOM)**

**Why:**
- Most true to Max Headroom aesthetic
- Emphasizes stuttering glitch loops (key Max Headroom feature)
- Strong neon lighting (cyan, magenta, electric blue)
- Geometric fragmentation (Max Headroom's angular look)
- Less pure gore, more stylized digital corruption
- Still dark and unsettling
- 795 chars (under 800 limit)

---

## **KEY DIFFERENCES FROM OLD PROMPT:**

**OLD PROMPT (Horror Focus):**
- "decomposing face screaming"
- "flesh dripping from skull"
- "blood-splattered screen cracks"
- "jaw unhinged revealing rotting teeth"
- Pure horror, minimal tech style

**NEW PROMPT V4 (Max Headroom Focus):**
- "digital broadcaster"
- "stuttering glitch loops"
- "geometric low-poly base"
- "neon lighting" (cyan, magenta, electric blue)
- "analog horror cyberpunk fusion"
- Stylized tech horror, true Max Headroom

## **USAGE:**

**Copy and paste VERSION 4 into Pollo.ai:**

```
Abraham Lincoln rendered as Max Headroom-style digital broadcaster, 1980s computer-generated look with modern corruption, stuttering glitch loops, face geometry fragmenting into angular polygons, harsh cyan rim lighting, magenta and electric blue color grading, chromatic RGB aberration splitting presidential features, digital static bursts, phosphor glow trails, scan line interference, retro CRT aesthetic, geometric low-poly base corrupting to hyperrealistic detail, neon green data streams, vertical sync errors, pixelated displacement mapping, broadcast signal decay, glitching repetitive mouth movements, analog horror cyberpunk fusion, sharp angular shadows, electronic interference patterns, digital ghost echoes, geometric face decomposition and reformation loops, 1987 broadcast malfunction, synthetic reality breaking down, 4K with intentional VHS artifacts, cinematic neon lighting, cursed transmission aesthetic

## **EXPECTED RESULTS:**

With Version 4, you should get:
- ✅ Max Headroom-style stuttering/glitching
- ✅ Geometric angular face (not just organic decay)
- ✅ Cyan/magenta neon lighting
- ✅ Digital corruption (not biological horror)
- ✅ Retro 1980s computer aesthetic
- ✅ Still dark and unsettling
- ✅ More stylized, less pure gore
- ✅ Broadcast interference look
- ✅ Repeating glitch loops (key Max Headroom trait)

## **ALTERNATIVES IF YOU WANT MORE HORROR:**

Use **Version 2** - balances dark horror with Max Headroom tech style.

**Or mix and match:**
- First 10 videos: Version 4 (pure Max Headroom)
- Next 10 videos: Version 2 (horror-tech balance)
- Last 10 videos: Version 3 (stylized horror-tech)

This gives variety while all staying true to Max Headroom aesthetic.
